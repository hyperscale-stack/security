# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format
is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The library is a multi-module workspace; modules are tagged independently
(`module/vX.Y.Z`). The entries below describe the ground-up rewrite that
replaced the v0 stack.

## [Unreleased]

The whole `v0.x` series is superseded by a transport-agnostic rewrite. The
legacy packages (`authentication/`, `authorization/`, the in-tree
`password` package, `authentication/provider/oauth2`) were removed.

### Added

- **Transport-agnostic core** (`github.com/hyperscale-stack/security`):
  immutable `Authentication`/`Principal`, `Carrier`, `Extractor`,
  `Authenticator`, first-success-wins `Manager`, `Engine`, typed
  `SecurityError` sentinels, and a `Clock` abstraction.
- **Authorization v2**: `Voter`/`Decision`/`Attribute`, an
  `AccessDecisionManager` with Affirmative/Consensus/Unanimous strategies,
  and a `voter/` catalog (`HasRole`, `HasAnyRole`, `HasScope`,
  `HasAuthority`, `HasPermission`, `Authenticated`, `Anonymous`,
  `FullyAuthenticated`, `And`/`Or`/`Not`).
- **HTTP adapter** (`httpsec`): `Middleware`, `Authorize`, a request/response
  `Carrier`, and a configurable `ErrorMapper`.
- **gRPC adapter** (`grpcsec`): unary and stream server interceptors,
  `UnaryAuthorize`/`StreamAuthorize`, a `metadata.MD` carrier, and an
  `ErrorMapper` to `codes.Code`.
- **ConnectRPC adapter** (`connectrpcsec`): `NewAuthenticationInterceptor`
  and `NewAuthorizationInterceptor` returning `connect.Interceptor` values
  (unary + streaming), an `http.Header` carrier, and an `ErrorMapper` to
  `connect.Code`.
- **Schemes**: `basic` (HTTP Basic extractor + authenticator) and `bearer`
  (Bearer extractor + pluggable `TokenVerifier`).
- **Password hashing** (`password`): `Hasher` interface with bcrypt and
  Argon2id implementations, context support, and `NeedsRehash`.
- **JWT** (`jwtsec`): `Signer`/`Verifier`, static and cached-remote JWKS,
  key rotation, `alg=none` and algorithm-confusion defenses, and a
  `bearer.TokenVerifier` adapter.
- **OAuth2 server** (`oauth2`): `Profile` (2.0 / 2.0-BCP / 2.1-draft),
  enforced at runtime on the grants (PKCE required, `plain` PKCE refused,
  refresh-token rotation forced under BCP / 2.1). Grants:
  `authorization_code` (PKCE), `client_credentials`,
  `refresh_token` (rotation + reuse detection), and the opt-in legacy
  `password` grant (`grant.NewLegacyPassword`, refused outside `Profile20`).
  `client_secret_basic`/`_post`/`none` client authentication. Endpoints:
  `/authorize` (authorization_code + opt-in legacy implicit flow, with an
  application-supplied consent hook), `/token`, `/revoke`, `/introspect`,
  and metadata — the metadata endpoint paths are configurable through
  `ServerConfig.RoutePrefix`. A `Storage` interface with explicit atomicity
  contracts.
- **OAuth2 storage backends**: in-memory (`oauth2/storage/memory`), SQL
  (`oauth2/store/sql`, Postgres/MySQL/SQLite), and Redis
  (`oauth2/store/redis`, Lua-script atomicity), all validated by the shared
  `oauth2/storetest` conformance suite.
- **Sessions** (`session`): stateless AES-256-GCM encrypted cookies with key
  rotation, a `Manager` (Login/Get/Touch/Rotate/Logout), and a
  synchronizer-token CSRF helper.
- **OAuth2 error hook**: `ServerConfig.OnError` and `grant.Config.OnError`
  (both `oauth2.ErrorHook`) observe every error the authorization server
  turns into an RFC 6749 §5.2 response — carrying the cause a `server_error`
  never puts on the wire — plus the errors it swallows on purpose, such as a
  best-effort revocation (RFC 7009 §2.2) or a family revocation that failed
  during reuse detection. Purely observational: the responses are unchanged.
- **OAuth2 profile consistency checks**: `oauth2.ProfileValidator`, an
  optional `Grant` capability: `oauth2.NewServer` asks every registered
  grant implementing it whether it can honor the active `Profile`, and
  refuses to build the server otherwise; the shipped `refresh_token` grant
  implements it. `grant.ErrRotationRequiresGenerator` reports a
  `refresh_token` grant that has to rotate refresh tokens but has no
  `grant.Config.RefreshTokens` generator to mint the replacement — returned
  by `NewServer`, and the cause of the `server_error` such a grant fails
  with at runtime, before any token is minted or persisted.
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry spans emitted directly by the core,
  `httpsec`, `grpcsec`, `connectrpcsec`, `jwtsec`, and `session`. See
  [docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md).
- **Documentation**: `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/observability.md`,
  `docs/security-considerations.md`, `docs/migration-from-v0.md`, and a
  refreshed `README.md`.
- **OAuth2 introspection policy**: `ServerConfig.IntrospectionPolicy`
  (`oauth2.IntrospectionPolicy`) decides which active tokens each caller of
  `/introspect` may see — the place to enforce resource and tenant
  boundaries (RFC 7662 §4). It receives the request context, the
  authenticated confidential caller and an `oauth2.IntrospectedToken` (its
  `oauth2.TokenKind`, client, subject, scope, audience, issuance and expiry —
  never the token value). A denial answers a bare `{"active":false}`, the
  same bytes as an unknown token; a policy error fails closed the same way
  and reaches `OnError` as a `server_error`. Optional: without a policy, any
  authenticated confidential client may introspect any token.
- **OAuth2 token-family primitives**: `oauth2.ErrTokenFamilyRevoked`
  (`invalid_grant`) refuses an operation on a revoked token family;
  `oauth2.ErrTokenFamilyRevocationFailed`, a plain sentinel that never
  reaches the wire, reports a family revocation that could not be recorded
  (the family must then be treated as active and the revocation retried);
  `oauth2.TokenPair.Validate` rejects a pair no store may persist (a refresh
  token outside the access token's family, without a family, or already
  consumed); `oauth2.MaxFamilyIDLength` (64 bytes) and
  `oauth2.FamilyRevocationRetention` (24h) bound family identifiers and how
  long a revoked family is remembered.

### Changed

- The repository is now a Go workspace (`go.work`) of independent modules,
  so consumers import only the pieces they need and the core stays free of
  heavy transitive dependencies.
- `Authentication` is immutable — authenticators return new values instead
  of mutating their input.
- `context.Context` is the first argument of every runtime operation
  (`Extract`, `Authenticate`, `Hasher.Hash`/`Verify`, `TokenVerifier.Verify`).
- Password `Verify` returns `(bool, error)`, distinguishing a mismatch from
  a malformed hash; v0 returned a bare `bool`.
- The JWT verifier (`jwtsec`) now rejects tokens without an `exp` claim by
  default (`ErrMissingExpiry`), aligning with RFC 9068 §2.2 and the
  fail-closed doctrine. Opt out with `jwtsec.WithOptionalExpiry()` to verify
  deliberately non-expiring assertions.

### Fixed

- The v0 authentication `Handler` no longer iterates past a successful
  authentication and no longer swallows provider errors — the `Manager`
  short-circuits on first success and aggregates failures.
- The OAuth2 client-secret mismatch is now a typed error
  (`ErrClientSecretMismatch`) instead of a silent failure.
- The OAuth2 `/token` response now computes `expires_in` from
  `ServerConfig.Now` instead of the wall clock, so an injected clock stays
  authoritative on the wire; the value is rounded to the nearest second (a
  1h TTL is advertised as `3600`, not `3599`) and an already-expired token
  drops the field rather than sending the negative lifetime RFC 6749 §5.1
  does not allow.
- A rotated OAuth2 refresh token keeps the scope of the token it replaces
  (RFC 6749 §6); narrowing the scope of a refresh only narrows the issued
  access token. The replacement used to inherit the narrowed scope, so the
  grant shrank permanently and a later request for the original scope was
  refused with `invalid_scope`.
- The `error_description` of `oauth2.ErrRefreshTokenReused` is now
  `refresh token reused`. The former `refresh token reused — family
  revoked` claimed a revocation that may have failed, and its em dash lies
  outside the RFC 6749 §5.2 `error_description` charset.

### Removed

- The legacy v0 packages: `authentication/`, `authentication/credential/`,
  `authentication/provider/{dao,oauth2}/`, `authorization/`, and the
  in-tree `password` package.

### Security

- The HTTP `DefaultErrorMapper` no longer reflects the wrapped error chain
  into the `WWW-Authenticate` header. The RFC 6750 `error_description` is now
  a fixed, generic string per error code, so internal context (timestamps,
  package and authenticator names, consumer-supplied `TokenVerifier`/store
  errors) can no longer leak to clients.
- The OAuth2 `refresh_token` grant now enforces the refresh-token rotation
  that `Profile20BCP` (the default) and `Profile21Draft` mandate (RFC 9700
  §4.14.2) — for every client, stricter than RFC 9700 §2.2.2, which only
  requires it (or sender-constrained refresh tokens) for public clients —
  whatever `grant.Config.RotateRefreshTokens` says: every exchange consumes
  the presented refresh token and returns a new one, and replaying a
  consumed token is refused with `invalid_grant` and revokes the whole
  family. The zero configuration used to let the same refresh token be
  replayed until it expired. Clients MUST keep the refresh token returned
  by each exchange (RFC 6749 §6). A grant that has to rotate but has no
  `grant.Config.RefreshTokens` generator — including under `Profile20`
  with `RotateRefreshTokens` set, which used to skip the rotation
  silently — is refused by `oauth2.NewServer`, and should it run anyway
  (called directly, or behind a decorator that hides it from `NewServer`)
  it fails with `server_error` before any token is minted or persisted.
  Non-rotating refresh tokens remain an explicit `Profile20` choice
  (`RotateRefreshTokens: false`).
- The OAuth2 `/introspect` endpoint now answers only clients whose
  `Type()` is `oauth2.ClientConfidential` (RFC 7662 §2.1 / §4, RFC 6749
  §2.2, §2.3). It used to answer any client the shared `ClientAuth` chain
  authenticated, so anyone knowing a public `client_id` — which is not a
  secret — could read the validity and claims of any token they held,
  refresh tokens included: through the `none` method, or through
  `client_secret_basic` / `client_secret_post` with the client's registered
  secret (Basic: even an empty one), whether or not `none` was registered.
  Public clients, whatever the method, and untyped clients (`Type() == ""`)
  authenticated through Basic or Post — `none` already refused them — now
  get `401 invalid_client`. This breaks deployments whose applications, or
  resource servers registered without a type, call `/introspect`. `/token`
  and `/revoke` are unchanged. The `none` method's `error_description` for
  a non-public client no longer contains a double quote, which RFC 6749
  §5.2 forbids. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).
